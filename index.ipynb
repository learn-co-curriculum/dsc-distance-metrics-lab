    "# Distance Metrics - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll calculate various distances between multiple points using the distance metrics we learned about!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate Euclidean Distance between 2 points\n",
    "* Calculate Manhattan Distance between 2 points\n",
    "* Compare and Contrast Manhattan, Euclidean, and Minkowski Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin this lab, we'll start by writing a generalized function to calculate any of the three distance metrics we've learned about. Let's review what we know so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How These Distance Metrics Are Related\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the previous lesson that **_Manhattan Distance_** and **_Euclidean Distance_** are both just special cases of **_Minkowski Distance_**. Take a look at the formula for Minkowski Distance below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='minkowski-equation.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Manhattan Distance_** is a special case where $r=1$ in the equation above (which means that we can remove the root operation and just keep the summation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Euclidean Distance_** is a special case where $r=2$ in the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, we can create a generalized `distance` function that just calculates minkowski distance, and takes in `r` as a parameter. That way, we can use the same function for every problem, and still calculate Manhattan and Euclidean distance metrics by just passing in the appropriate values for the `r` parameter!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete the `distance` function. \n",
    "* This function should take in 3 arguments:\n",
    "    * `a`, a tuple or array that describes a vector in n-dimensional space. \n",
    "    * `b`, a tuple or array that describes a vector in n-dimensional space (this must be the same length as `a`!)\n",
    "    * `r`, which tells us the norm to calculate the vector space (if set to `1`, the result will be Manhattan, while `2` will calculate Euclidean distance)\n",
    "* Since euclidean distance is the most common distance metric used, this function should default to using `r=2` if no value is set for `r`.\n",
    "* Include a parameter called `verbose` which is set to `True` by default. If true, the function should print out if the distance metric returned is a measurement of Manhattan, Euclidean, or Minkowski distance.  \n",
    "* This function should implement the minkowski distance equation above, and return the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_**  Remember that for Manhattan Distance, you need to make use of `np.abs()` to get the absolute value of the distance for each dimension, since we don't have the squaring function to make this positive for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "**_HINT:_** Use `np.power()` as an easy way to implement both squares and square roots. `np.power(a, 3)` will return the cube of `a`, while `np.power(a, 1/3)` will return the cube root of 3. For more information on this function, see the numpy [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.power.html)!"
